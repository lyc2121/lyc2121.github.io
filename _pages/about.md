## About Me

I am currently a **Postdoctoral Researcher** specializing in **transporation knowledge graphs** and **autonomous driving** at **KTH Royal Institute of Technology**. I completed my PhD in Transportation from the **South China University of Technology** in 2024 .  My research interests include  **environmental perception for autonomous driving** and **integrating LLMs for transporation knowledge graphs**.
